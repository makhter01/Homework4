In the early 90s, extending the power of network computing to the activities of everyday
life was a radical vision. In 1991, a small group of Sun engineers called the "Green Team" believed that
the next wave in computing was the union of digital consumer devices and computers.
 Led by James Gosling, the team worked around the clock and created the programming language
 that would revolutionize our world â€“ Java.
 Today, Java not only permeates the Internet, but also is the invisible force
 behind many of the applications and devices that power our day-to-day lives.
 From mobile phones to handheld devices,
  games and navigation systems to e-business solutions, Java is everywhere!
